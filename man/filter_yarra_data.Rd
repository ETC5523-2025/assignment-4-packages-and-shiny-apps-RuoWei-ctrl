\title{Filter Yarra River water quality data}
\usage{
filter_yarra_data(data, parameter_name, site_name = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame with the same columns as \code{yarra_wq}.
Typically you will just pass \code{yarra_wq}.}

\item{parameter_name}{A string giving the parameter to filter on,
for example \code{"pH"}, \code{"temperature"}, \code{"turbidity"}, \code{"dissolved_oxygen"}.
This will be matched to the \code{parameter} column.}

\item{site_name}{Optional. A string giving the site to filter on
(matching the \code{name} column, e.g. \code{"YARRA @ CHANDLER HWY"}).
If \code{NULL} (the default), all sites are included.}
}
\value{
A tibble/data.frame containing only rows that match the requested
parameter and (if provided) site. If nothing matches, the returned
tibble will have 0 rows.
}
\description{
This helper function returns a filtered version of the \code{yarra_wq} dataset
(included in the yarraWQ package). It lets you select which water quality
parameter to look at (for example "pH", "temperature", "turbidity"),
and optionally limit to a single monitoring site.
}
\details{
This is useful because both the plotting function (\code{plot_yarra_metric()})
and the Shiny app do the same type of filtering. Putting this logic in one
place avoids repeating the same code in multiple places.
}
\examples{
# Keep only pH measurements (all sites):
# filtered <- filter_yarra_data(yarra_wq, parameter_name = "pH")

# Keep only pH at one specific site:
# filtered_site <- filter_yarra_data(
#   yarra_wq,
#   parameter_name = "pH",
#   site_name = "YARRA @ CHANDLER HWY"
# )

}
